# Reed-Solomon Error Correcting Codes in C

The purpose of this project was to implement the encoding and decoding of Reed-Solomon codes and perform simulations to measure the error correcting effectiveness of the codes under various random errors. I chose to implement this in C, using 32 bit integers to represent field elements and arrays of these integers to represent the coefficients of polynomials. This resulted in the fastest implementation in the class.

A full description of the project including description of the simulation procedure and a comparison with the theoretical error rate are given in the full length writeup: CS127_Final.pdf
